Revision history for MooseX-NonMoose

{{$NEXT}}

0.08  2010-05-20
      - Fix inheriting from classes which don't bless their instances into the
        correct class when subclassing (jhallock).

      - Update for things fixed in latest Moose.

0.07  2009-09-27
      - Start adding support for non-Moose destructors. Destructor inlining
        isn't supported yet, since Moose isn't quite flexible enough there for
        it to be more than an annoying hack, but this should still work with
        immutable classes anyway.

0.06  2009-09-27
      - defining a custom constructor in a class using mx-nonmoose now works

      - use a less broken test for whether or not a superclass has an inlined
        constructor (fixes issue uncovered by fixes to Moose's metaclass
        compatibility fixing)

0.05  2009-06-24
      - gaaaaah, packaging is so stupid (remove stray test.pl file)

0.04  2009-06-23
      - Add tests and official support for alternate instance metaclasses, such
        as MooseX::GlobRef and MooseX::InsideOut - including supplying a custom
        exporter MooseX::NonMoose::InsideOut which should work in all possible
        cases, when just using the same hash that the nonmoose class is using
        would break

      - Fix a couple issues with inheriting from MooseX::NonMoose classes -
        make sure FOREIGNBUILDARGS is only called once, and fix some issues
        with immutability

0.03  2009-05-06
      - Add a FOREIGNBUILDARGS method to support modifying the argument list
        passed to the non-Moose constructor

0.02  2009-04-29
      - A few minor doc fixes

0.01  2009-04-20
      - Initial release
